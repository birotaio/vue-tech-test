# Vue Technical Test

Technical test for front-end job application

## Context

At Zoov, we develop an internal web app in VueJS, used to visualize and manage our bikes, trips, users and interact with our service – via our API – for support, operation and maintenance purposes. This web app is used on desktop for support client, developers and admins and on mobile for technicians on the field. The key tool is a map which aims to display the position and state of our bikes (alongside with other geolocalized entities).

We also develop several tools and web pages in VueJS, based our eveloving [design system](https://github.com/birotaio/zoov-design-system/tree/master/web).

## Goal

You will develop a minimalistic static Vue app with little requirements. Its goal is to embed a map to display markers as bikes, fetched from a simple fake API.
- Use any UI component library of your choice. A great bonus will be to use partly of fully – and challenge – the internal design system that we are currently developing: [@zoov/design-system](https://github.com/birotaio/zoov-design-system/tree/master/web).
- Choose any map provider you are familiar with.
- Display markers on map to represent bikes in their different states.
- These markers can be clicked to open more information on the bike and optionnaly change its state (see [Optional, a step further](#optional-a-step-further) section).

## API

We faked an API with JSON data representation using [jsonbox.io](https://jsonbox.io/). To interact with it, read the [documentation](https://github.com/vasanthv/jsonbox).

### Initialization

In a terminal, simply run:
```sh
sh init-box.sh <box_id>
```
with `box_id` a valid box id:
> at least 20 chars long & max. 64 chars,

according to the documentation. You json box will be populated with "bike" documents. (If you mess up playing with the data, you can start over with a new `box_id`). The data will be kept 30 days.

### Get bikes

```http
GET https://jsonbox.io/<box_id>
```

The simple bike data model we retained is:
```js
{
  // generated by jsonbox.io
  _id: String,
  _createdOn: String,
  // bike data model
  serial_number: String,
  location: {
    type: "Point",
    coordinates: [Number, Number], // longitude, lattitude
  },
  in_order: Boolean,
  service_status: Number,
  battery_level: Number, // from 0 to 100%
}
```

And the status model is and enum:
- `1`: free
- `2`: booked
- `3`: in use

### Optional, a step further

Several actions could be triggerd from the web app:
- Update bike state using `PUT https://jsonbox.io/<box_id>`
- Add bike(s) using `POST https://jsonbox.io/<box_id>`
- Delete bike(s) using `DELETE https://jsonbox.io/<box_id>`
- And anything that seems relevant to you

Last but not least, you can update bike model to add data that seems appropriate...
